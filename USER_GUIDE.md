# ASDD — Install & First-Project Guide

This bundle is everything you need to install the ASDD CLI on a new Mac, build
the project container image, and run your first project — either interactively
or as a scheduled background job.

This is the **slim** bundle: just the asdd CLI and the pieces it actually
uses at runtime. The sibling packages from the upstream monorepo (`kernel/`,
`agents/`, `dashboards/`, `browser_runner/`) and the contracts they own
(`specs/001-…`, `specs/002-…`, `specs/005-…`) are not included. The
`Dockerfile.project` in this bundle has been slimmed to match — no orphaned
COPY lines.

---

## 1. What's in this bundle

```
asdd-bundle/
├── USER_GUIDE.md                              ← this file
├── README.md                                  ← upstream repo README
├── pyproject.toml                             ← installs the `asdd` console script
├── asdd/                                      ← the CLI Python package (only one)
├── docker/
│   ├── Dockerfile.project                     ← project-container image (slimmed)
│   └── files/asdd-run-job.sh                  ← in-container job runner
├── specs/007-asdd-architecture/contracts/     ← schemas asdd reads at import time
└── controlvault-skeleton/_templates/          ← scaffold copied into every new project
```

The unpacked directory **is** your ASDD source tree on this machine. Do not
delete or move it after install — the CLI computes paths relative to where
this tree lives (`Dockerfile.project` is loaded from `<bundle>/docker/`, the
templates from `<bundle>/controlvault-skeleton/_templates/`, the JSON schemas
from `<bundle>/specs/007-…/contracts/`). A good home is `~/asdd/`.

Python dependencies installed by `pip`/`pipx`: `PyYAML`, `jsonschema`, `click`.
That's it.

---

## 2. Host prerequisites

Install these on the target Mac before running any `asdd` command.

| Dependency       | Why                                              | Install                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker or OrbStack | The CLI shells out to `docker build` / `docker run`.       | https://orbstack.dev/ (recommended on macOS) or Docker Desktop. |
| Python 3.12+     | `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python >=3.12`. | `brew install python@3.12`                                  |
| `pipx` (optional) | Cleanest way to install a console script in isolation. | `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`                      |
| `git`            | `asdd new --from-remote` clones repos via `git`.          | `brew install git` (Xcode CLT also works)                   |
| Claude Code      | Lives **inside** the container, but auth is read from your host `~/.claude/`. Install it on the host once, run `claude login`. | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` then `claude login` |

Optional, for autonomous-mode (`asdd dispatch`) without an operator shell:

| Dependency        | Why                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var | Autonomous-mode does not mount `~/.claude/`; it passes this var into the container. |

You do **not** need `uv`, `sops`, `age`, or `node` on the host — those are
pre-installed inside the project image.

---

## 3. Install the ASDD CLI

```bash
# 1. Pick a permanent home for the bundle and unpack into it.
mkdir -p ~/asdd
tar -xzf asdd-bundle.tar.gz -C ~/asdd --strip-components=1
cd ~/asdd

# 2. Install in editable mode. Editable is REQUIRED — the CLI resolves the
#    Dockerfile and template paths relative to this directory.
pipx install --editable . --python python3.12
# or, without pipx:
#   python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .

# 3. Verify
asdd --help
```

You should see the `asdd` subcommands: `init`, `new`, `list`, `pause`,
`resume`, `archive`, `open`, `close`, `ps`, `dispatch`, `secrets …`.

### Pick where projects live

Set `ASDD_HOME` to the directory where projects, registry, and templates
will land. Default is `~/Code/asdd`.

```bash
# In ~/.zshrc (persisted across shells)
export ASDD_HOME=$HOME/AI-Hub/asdd
```

Open a new shell so the variable takes effect.

---

## 4. Initialise `ASDD_HOME`

```bash
asdd init
```

This is idempotent and creates:

```
$ASDD_HOME/
├── _state/           ← projects.yml registry, audit.log
├── _archive/         ← archived projects (empty on day one)
├── projects/         ← per-project workspaces (one dir per project)
└── _templates/       ← copied from the bundle's controlvault-skeleton/_templates/
```

---

## 5. Create a project that pulls in an existing GitHub repo

`asdd new <id> --from-remote <git-url>` clones the repo into
`$ASDD_HOME/projects/<id>/` and lays the spec-driven-development scaffolding
(`.specify/`, `inbox/`, `jobs/`, `results/`, `schedule/`, `_state/`,
`specs/`, a starter `constitution.md`) on top — on a **separate branch**
called `asdd/bootstrap`, so your project's `main` stays untouched.

```bash
# Example: pull in github.com/octocat/Hello-World as a new ASDD project
# called "hello-world".
asdd new hello-world \
  --from-remote https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git \
  --name "Hello World" \
  --description "First test project"
```

Verify:

```bash
asdd list
# ID                       STATE        NAME
# hello-world              active       Hello World

ls $ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world
# .git  .specify  README  _state  inbox  jobs  results  schedule  specs
```

The repo's existing files are preserved on `main`; the scaffolding sits on
`asdd/bootstrap`. Switch between them with normal git.

> **First-time build note**: the next step (`asdd open` or `asdd dispatch`)
> will trigger a one-time `docker build` of `controlvault/project:latest`,
> which takes ~30–60 seconds. The CLI streams the build output so it isn't
> silent.

---

## 6. Interactive Claude session inside the container

```bash
asdd open hello-world
```

You land at a bash prompt **inside** the container, at `/asdd_home`. The
prompt looks like:

```
asdd@<container-id>:/asdd_home$
```

Three things are bind-mounted from your Mac:
- the project workspace at `/asdd_home` (read/write)
- your `~/.claude/` directory (so Claude Code is already logged in)
- your `~/.claude.json` file (same reason)

Everything else on the Mac is invisible — `ls /` won't show your home dir or
other projects.

Start an interactive Claude session:

```
asdd@…:/asdd_home$ claude
> /speckit-specify add a /healthz endpoint
```

Spec-kit slash commands work out of the box because `.specify/integration.json`
was wired in during `asdd new`.

**To leave**, just `exit` the shell. The container stops automatically — no
processes remain on the host (`docker ps` is empty).

If you killed your terminal or lost the SSH connection, clean up manually:

```bash
asdd close hello-world
```

---

## 7. Define a job for autonomous execution

A "job" is **just a markdown file** whose body is piped to `claude --print`
inside the container. No frontmatter is required.

Constraints:
1. The file must exist.
2. The path must be **under** that project's workspace (i.e. somewhere inside
   `$ASDD_HOME/projects/<id>/`), because that's the only path the container
   can see.

Convention is to drop job-notes into `inbox/`:

```bash
mkdir -p $ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world/inbox

cat > $ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world/inbox/audit.md <<'EOF'
# job: dependency audit

Read package.json, list every dependency, and flag any that have
not had a release in the last 24 months. Output a short markdown table.
EOF
```

---

## 8. Run a job now (one-shot dispatch)

```bash
# Production: needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY because the container does not
# mount your host ~/.claude/ in autonomous mode.
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…

asdd dispatch hello-world \
  $ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world/inbox/audit.md
```

What happens:
1. The project's container starts in **autonomous mode** (workspace mount
   only — no operator credentials inside).
2. `asdd-run-job` reads the markdown file and pipes its body to
   `claude --print`.
3. Claude's stdout is written to
   `$ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world/results/audit.result.md`.
4. The container stops. `docker ps` is empty again.

The CLI prints the result path to stdout.

### Test path (no LLM calls / no API key)

```bash
export ASDD_JOB_STUB_OUTPUT="canned response for testing"
asdd dispatch hello-world $ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world/inbox/audit.md
# audit.result.md contains "canned response for testing"
```

Useful for verifying the dispatch pipeline end-to-end without spending tokens.

---

## 9. Schedule a job for later

The ASDD CLI itself has **no built-in scheduler** — `asdd dispatch` is a
fire-now primitive. To run something later, use macOS's standard `at`(1)
daemon, which is purpose-built for one-off scheduled commands.

### One-time setup on a fresh Mac

`atrun` ships disabled on modern macOS. Enable it once:

```bash
sudo launchctl load -F /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist
```

This survives reboots.

### Schedule a single run

```bash
echo "export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…; \
      $(which asdd) dispatch hello-world \
        $ASDD_HOME/projects/hello-world/inbox/audit.md \
        > $HOME/asdd-dispatch.log 2>&1" \
  | at 21:00
```

Other time forms `at` accepts:
- `at now + 30 minutes`
- `at 9am tomorrow`
- `at 14:00 saturday`

Inspect and manage:

```bash
atq           # list queued jobs
atrm <jobid>  # remove a queued job
```

### Caveats to know

- `at` runs in a **non-interactive shell** — your `.zshrc` exports aren't
  loaded. Put any env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ASDD_HOME`) inline in the
  command you pipe to `at`, or `source` your `~/.zshrc` first.
- Use absolute paths. The example above uses `$(which asdd)` and the full
  `$ASDD_HOME` path for that reason.
- `at` does **not** wake a sleeping Mac. If the Mac is asleep at the fire
  time, the job runs whenever the Mac next wakes. If you need wake-from-sleep,
  use `launchd` with `StartCalendarInterval` + `WakeFromSleep=true` instead
  (heavier setup; not covered here).
- Redirect stdout/stderr to a file (the example uses `$HOME/asdd-dispatch.log`).
  Otherwise `at` mails the output via local Postfix, which is rarely useful.

## 10. Useful inspection commands

```bash
asdd list                 # registered projects
asdd ps                   # currently-running project containers
asdd close <id>           # force-stop a project's container

ls $ASDD_HOME/projects/<id>/results/   # past job outputs
docker images controlvault/project     # image storage on the host
docker logs controlvault-project-<id>  # if a container is misbehaving
```

---

## 11. Per-project secrets (optional)

If a project needs API keys other than `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, ASDD ships a
SOPS + age based secret store. Setup is one-time:

```bash
# Generate an age keypair (do this once per Mac)
age-keygen -o ~/.config/age/keys.txt
# Add the recipient to ~/.zshrc:
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=$HOME/.config/age/keys.txt
export SOPS_AGE_RECIPIENTS=age1…   # the recipient line from keys.txt
```

Then:

```bash
asdd secrets add hello-world DATABASE_URL --value "postgres://…"
asdd secrets list hello-world
asdd secrets remove hello-world DATABASE_URL
```

Secrets are decrypted on the host at dispatch/open time and passed into the
container as environment variables (never written to disk inside).

You don't need this for the smoke test in §5–§9.

---

## 12. Uninstall / clean slate

```bash
# Stop everything and remove the registry/projects:
asdd ps | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}' | xargs -n1 asdd close 2>/dev/null
rm -rf "$ASDD_HOME"

# Drop the image:
docker rmi controlvault/project:latest

# Remove the CLI:
pipx uninstall asdd
# (or `pip uninstall asdd` if you used a venv)

# Optionally remove the bundle source tree:
rm -rf ~/asdd
```

---

## Quick reference card

```
asdd init                                    initialise $ASDD_HOME
asdd new <id> --from-remote <url>            create project from existing repo
asdd new <id>                                create empty project
asdd list                                    show projects
asdd open <id>                               interactive shell in container
asdd close <id>                              force-stop container
asdd ps                                      list running containers
asdd dispatch <id> <job.md>                  run one job now (autonomous)
asdd secrets {add,remove,list} <id> [args]   manage per-project secrets

echo '<cmd>' | at <time>                     fire <cmd> once at <time>
atq        atrm <n>                          inspect / cancel scheduled jobs
```
